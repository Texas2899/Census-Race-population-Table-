    <h1>Census Race Population Data Analysis Questions</h1>
    <img src="logo.png">
    <p>According to this table, do people who are white only , make up majority of the US population? Do majority of the people who are 3 or more races have American Indian in them?</p>
    <p>The Race population table on the Census website, the data i chose to analyse, shows the population of people who are one race, and people who are multiracial. It also shows the population of each race group, and shows population and what races in the multiracial groups.
    <p>I came up with my questions by looking at the and seeing which race alone makes up majority of the population and which race makes up majority of the population that are 3 different races</p>
    <p>I obtained this data from the census website. I looked through the table and found out that majority of the US population is white only. Once looking through the table even more I determined that majority of the population that has more races then one, has some American Indian in them.</p>
    <p>I went through all of the links presented on the assignment page and found a data that was easy for me to read and analyse. The Census, provided tables that were easy to read and analyse the data presented. The Census website also made it super easy to download it to microsoft excel.</p>
    <p>I chose the Race Population data set because it was the one data set that gave me the best ideas for my hypotheses/questions. It came with alot of information and seperated the infromation well enough for me to be able to come up with different hypotheses.
